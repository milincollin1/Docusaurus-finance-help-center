# Crafting Your First Budget

Building a budget is the first step towards financial security.

### 1. Calculate Your Income

List all income sources:
- Salary  
- Rental income (e.g. $3,000/month)  
- Side work  

### 2. Track Your Expenses

Use a spreadsheet or app to log:
- Mortgage  
- Utilities, groceries, transportation  
- Debt payments  
- Discretionary spending  


### 3. Allocate Funds

Follow the 50/30/20 rule:
- 50% Needs  
- 30% Wants  
- 20% Savings & Debt Repayment  

### 4. Automate & Adjust

Automate transfers for savings and bill pay. Review monthly and tweak categories.
